# Blog-Site

A blog website for the Minnesota Vikings football team using ejs that allows posts to be created and read with a date stamp showing when the post was created. The site has several views including home, about, contact, compose, and post.
I'm using Node.js to handle all the HTTP requests (get and post) and ejs for each of the different views.
